                With benefits comparable with a major medical insurance plan,
                short-term medical (STM) insurance provides coverage that is
                designed for your needs, peace of mind, and financial well-being
                from the ever-rising costs of healthcare expenses.

                Persons insured under this plan may choose to be treated within, or out of, the Multiplan PHCS PPO Network.
                This membership entitles doctors and hospital facilities who have contracted to provide specific medical care at negotiated prices.
