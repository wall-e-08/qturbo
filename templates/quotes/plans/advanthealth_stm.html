                <p>Consider the benefit period and choose payment method:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <br>
                       This option is ideal if it is known exactly how many days the coverage is needed. The minimum number of days that members
                        may apply for coverage is 30 days; the maximum is 90 days. Payment via Visa, MasterCard, or bank draft is accepted.

                        <br>
                        This plan gives members the flexibility to continue coverage for as long as it is needed and allows them to discontinue
                        the plan once their temporary need ends. Members can select coverage periods of up to 3 months. Payment via Visa, MasterCard,
                        or bank draft is accepted.In addition to the ability to apply for up to 3 months of coverage, members have the option at the
                        time of enrollment to apply for a second policy for up to 3 months of coverage: Pre-existing condition waiver rider availability varies by state.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        The selected deductible must be paid by each Covered Person before Coinsurance benefits are payable. After 3 individuals meet
                        their deductible, the deductible is deemed satisfied for any remaining covered individuals..

                        <br>
                        The selection of a Coinsurance Percentage represents the percent of covered eligible expenses
                        that we pay and that members pay after the deductible has been satisfied up to the Out Of Pocket Maximum.

                <p class="emphasize">Does the plan require Pre-Certification?</p>
                <p>
                    All Inpatient hospitalizations and procedures done at an Outpatient Surgery Facility
                    must be pre-certified. Everest Reinsurance Company's professional review organization
                    must be contacted as soon as possible before the expense is to be incurred. If the
                    Covered Person does not comply with the Pre-certification requirements as stated in
                    the insurance certificate, the Eligible Medical Expenses will be reduced by 50%.
                </p>

                <p class="emphasize">What is the waiver of pre-existing conditions?</p>
                <p>
                    The pre-existing condition limitation will not apply to any conditions that were covered during the prior coverage period.
                    Any other pre-existing conditions will remain subject to the limitation as described in the Certificate of Insurance. Pre-existing
                    condition waiver rider availability varies by state.

                <p class="emphasize">How does Usual and Customary Fees affect my benefits?</p>
                <p>
                    The Policy defines Usual and Customary Fees as the usual, fair and reasonable fee for medical
                    treatment provided to a Covered Person (or any other form of medical care, procedure,
                    drug or supply).
                </p>
                <p>In determining a Usual and Customary Fee, the Company at its discretion, consults:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>one (1) or more standard industry sources to calculate services of comparable severity and

                        to produce and deliver such treatment and/or the charge most commonly paid for such treatment.
                        The standard industry sources utilize cost-based formula methodology and/or pricing data
                        (updated semi-annually) to produce replicable and consistent cost and/or pricing parameters;
                    </li>
                    <li>the cost to the health care provider of performing or providing the medical treatment,
                        including reasonable allowance for overhead and profit;
